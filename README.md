Linked List :

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
This is just a small representation of linked list using Python

Coding Linked List is a very simple task and simpler when it comes to implementing it in python 

As we all know python is famous scripting language and when creating a Linked list in python the concept
of OOPS comes in handy 

So just by using the functionality of Classes and Objects you can create a Linked List

I have tried to explain my code as much as possible but you will deepely understand it when you will run it and create it by 
yourself

Happy Learning !!
